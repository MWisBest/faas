# Fucks as a Service by the Institute for Unnecessary Technology

## Introduction

We at the Institute for Unnecessary Technology are pleased to announce our
newest product, Fucks as a Service, but before we delve into that we'd like to
speak a bit about our company and our vision. 

As chief scientist of the Institute, I, Christopher De Vries, am charged with
making products which do not enrich your life, but instead accompany you in
your march toward your inevitable death. Items such as our dad joke server,
our defunct blog, and our line of unscented perfumes are not such much runaway
hits as they are things you will have trouble finding through Google. Think of
us as a less successful Sharper Image for the new millennium. Well all that is
about to stay remarkably the same, with the introduction of Fucks as a
Service.

2017 has been a tough year, and we've had to give a lot of fucks. These fucks
can best be described in the medium of memes.

* We've had the inauguration of Donald Trump.<br/> ![How the fuck did this guy win?](static/piccard_win.jpg)
* The attempt to eliminate the Affordable Care Act.<br/> ![Get the fuck off my
  Obamacare](static/rent_obamacare.jpg)
* The revelation that most men you admire probably tried to assault a woman or
  a child at some point.<br/> ![What the fuck is wrong with
  men?](static/herbert_men.jpg)
* And the new tax plan, which leaves middle-class taxes essentially
  unchanged.<br/>

This has left most of us dangerously depleted when it comes to fucks.

This seems like a problem which can be solved through the use of unnecessary
cloud technology, which is why we have introduced Fucks as a Service. Fucks as
a service provides fucks from an almost inexhaustible supply of fucks in the
cloud. You just ask for the number of fucks you need, and they are provided
through our user-friendly API.
